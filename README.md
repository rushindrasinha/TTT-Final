4. Synced with Firebase (Turn Counter, Score, Pieces)

##### Known Bugs
1. On Game End only 1 screen shows victory (the screen that won) [Need to Sync the victory images to firebase]
2. Game Crashes sometimes when playing too quick [Might be related to Tie Logic]
3. Click Sounds are local and need to be synced to firebase to become global.
